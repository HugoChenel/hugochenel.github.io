After years of documentation and experimentation, I gradually improved my mental/athletic performance and maintained an optimal health. Currently, my biomarkers put me in the top 1% for my age. On this page, you can find my basic (and advanced) protocol, as well as what I’m regularly tracking to measure change or progress.

*Disclaimer : This is a guide, take what works for you and personalize it. Welcome to the journey of optimized health! Remember, this protocol is adapted to my genetics and lifestyle, so it might not be ideal for everyone. Above all, perform regular blood tests to understand how any changes influence your biomarkers. Your data will be your best guide.*

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 30px 0;">

# First principles

Understanding the core biological processes behind aging is essential. By focusing on these key processes, you can create a biohacking strategy that targets the root causes of aging and not only treat symptoms. These foundational mechanisms can directly influence vitality, performance and longevity. Renowned biohackers and longevity researchers, including *Dr. David Sinclair*, *Dr. Valter Longo*, *Dr. Rhonda Patrick*, *Dr. Steven Gundry* and *Dr. Aubrey de Grey*, all emphasize targeting these processes to extend healthspan.
<br>

**Cellular senescence**
<br>
As we age, some cells stop dividing and become senescent. Think of them as zombie cells. Why? they’re alive but no longer functional (in a sleep state), they even start causing trouble by releasing harmful chemicals that affect surrounding cells. 
<br>
Removing these zombie cells through protocols such as fasting, exercise or using senolytic compounds (like quercetin and fisetin found in onion) can help keep tissues healthier.

**Autophagy and apoptosis**
<br>
Autophagy is the process of clearing out damaged cellular components, while apoptosis is the controlled death of old or/and damaged cells. Both are essential for maintaining cellular health.
<br>
Strategies like intermittent fasting and supplements like spermidine can trigger autophagy and help the body to clean out cellular “junk”. This rejuvenates cells and helps keep tissues functioning optimally. Also, Nrf2 activation (via compounds like sulforaphane) promotes the production of detoxifying enzymes that help eliminate toxins or harmful byproducts that accumulate over time, to preserve the integrity of various cellular components.

**Stem cell function**
<br>
Stem cells are responsible for repairing and regenerating tissues. With age, stem cell numbers and activity decrease, meaning our body repairs damage more slowly.
<br>
Fasting and specific diets (like Fasting-mimicking diet from Dr. Valter Longo) can help stimulate stem cell production. Advanced therapies like stem cell injections are available in most places, but for now, fasting is a more accessible option to boost stem cell activity.

**DNA damage and repair**
<br>
Our DNA is like our body’s instruction manual, but over time, it gets damaged from various events like pollution, UV radiation or even natural metabolic processes. This damage accumulates, causing cells to function less effectively.
<br>
Maintaining DNA stability and supporting DNA repair mechanisms by protecting your genetic blueprint is a key element to stop or reverse aging. Boosting NAD+ with compounds like NMN, NR or apigenin can help. 
<br>
*Measure NAD+ levels using a basic test to eventually supplement yourself.*

**Telomere shortening**
<br>
Telomeres are protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes. Every time a cell divides, telomeres get a little shorter, and when they’re too short, the cell can no longer divide. Shorter telomeres are linked to aging and disease.
<br>
Some lifestyle choices like regular exercise, stress reduction and restful sleep have been shown to slow down telomere shortening. In addition, TA-65, a compound derived from astragalus root, has been shown to activate telomerase, the enzyme responsible for adding length to telomeres.
<br>
*Use a test to track your cellular age based on your telomere length like TeloYears.*

**Mitochondrial dysfunction**
<br>
Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cells, generating the energy you need to live. As we age, mitochondria become less efficient, leading to fatigue, muscle weakness and way slower recovery.
<br>
Supporting mitochondrial health with exercise is really important. The best type of exercise for this is high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and resistance training, which encourage the body to produce new mitochondria. Supplements like CoQ10 and PQQ have also been shown to support mitochondrial function.

**Loss of proteostasis**
<br>
Over time, proteins in cells can become misfolded or damaged, disrupting cell function. In a youthful and well functioning body, these misfolded proteins are broken down and recycled, but aging slows down this cleaning process, leading to cellular clutter.
<br>
Fasting and caloric restriction trigger autophagy, where cells clean up damaged proteins. Incorporating periodic fasting or intermittent fasting can help maintain cellular health.

**Epigenetic changes**
<br>
Epigenetics involves changes in the way genes are expressed without changing the DNA itself. Age-related epigenetic changes can activate “bad” genes and turn off “good” ones, leading to aging.
<br>
Exercise, a clean diet, caloric restriction and supplements like resveratrol (found in grapes and red wine) can help maintain youthful gene expression, keeping cells functioning optimally.
<br>
*Estimate your biological age based on DNA methylation patterns using DunedinPACE.*

**Nutrient sensing and metabolism**
<br>
Nutrient-sensing pathways, including insulin/IGF-1 signaling, mTOR and AMPK, are vital regulators of metabolism and play a significant role in the aging process. These pathways detect and respond to nutrient availability, adjusting cellular and metabolic activities accordingly.
<br>
By modulating these pathways through dietary interventions (calorie restriction, fasting, low-protein diet, ketogenic diet, high-fiber diet) or pharmacological methods (berberine, curcumin, resveratrol), it's possible to slow down age-related cellular damage.

**Chronic inflammation or “inflammaging”**
<br>
Bodies develop low-level, chronic inflammation, often without us even realizing it. This type of “silent inflammation” speeds up aging and is linked to most major diseases. Acute inflammation is beneficial, chronic inflammation is detrimental.
<br>
Combat inflammation through anti-inflammatory foods (like fatty fish rich in EPA/DHA, leafy greens vegetables and spices), regular exercise and optimal sleep. Omega-3 supplements and curcumin are particularly anti-inflammatory.
<br>
*Measure your level of CRP (C-reactive protein) to evaluate the inflammation in your body.*

**Oxidative stress and free radicals**
<br>
Free radicals are molecules that can damage cells and they’re a natural byproduct of metabolism. However, when free radicals accumulate faster than your body can handle, they cause oxidative stress, leading to dysfunction. 
<br>
Beta-alanine, by increasing carnosine levels, contributes to anti-aging processes primarily through its role as an acid buffer against lactic acid build-up in cells, particularly in muscle tissue. Also, polyphenols from colorful fruits and vegetables help neutralize free radicals. Glutathione, vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid are powerful choices for their antioxidant effects.

**Circadian rhythm disruption**
<br>
Your circadian rhythm is your internal clock. It controls sleep, energy and even hormone production. Disrupting this rhythm (through irregular sleep schedules, blue light exposure at night, etc.) accelerates aging.
<br>
Maintaining a regular sleep-wake cycle, getting morning sunlight and avoiding blue light before bed can help keep the circadian rhythm in sync, supporting better overall health.
<br>
*Use a sleep tracker (Whoop or Oura) to monitor sleep.*

**Glycation and AGE accumulation**
<br>
Glycation is when sugar molecules bind to proteins or fats, forming harmful compounds called AGEs (Advanced Glycation End-products) that lead to rigid, less elastic tissues. This phenomenon is the consequence of sugar damage.
<br>
Reducing sugar intake, more particularly high-glycemic foods, and increasing intake of antioxidant-rich foods is the best strategy to reduce AGEs. Antioxidants also have the capacity to break down AGEs, protecting the cells.
<br>
*Measure blood glucose and HbA1c, which correspond to long-term blood sugar.*

**Hormone decline**
<br>
Hormones like testosterone, estrogen, growth hormone and melatonin naturally fluctuate with age, impacting everything from muscle mass to mood to sleep quality. Balancing the key hormones is a necessity for vitality.
<br>
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) under medical supervision is a possibility, but you can also support your hormones naturally with resistance training, proper nutrition and some supplements like Tongkat ali and Horny goat weed.
<br>
*Check your hormone level (testosterone, estrogen, prolactin) during your yearly blood test.*

**Impaired intercellular communication**
<br>
Cells communicate less effectively with time, which can result in uncoordinated responses to damage and contribute to immune system decline.
<br>
Hormesis (small, controlled stresses) induces from exercise, cold/heat exposure, plant toxins or fasting can *reset* cell communication. Additionally, anti-inflammatory practices reduce *noise* in cellular signals.

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 30px 0;">

# Master the basics
Following the Pareto principle, we recognize that roughly 20% of our actions lead to 80% of our results. Applying this principle, you can obtain great results with the basics: sleep, diet, exercise and a simple supplement/nootropic stack, that yield maximum benefits with consistent, long-term impact.

**Sleep**<br>
Quality sleep is non-negotiable, forming the base for physical and cognitive performance. Prioritizing early morning sunlight, managing evening light exposure and creating a cool, dark sleep environment significantly enhances sleep quality. These simple adjustments stabilize my circadian rhythm, deepen sleep stages and improve recovery (allowing me to wake up refreshed everyday). Most people need 7-9 hours of sleep per night, but it really depends on your genetics and lifestyle (physical activity, diet, stress). Quantity AND quality are important. Sleep is crucial because it amplifies the effectiveness of every other health intervention.

**Diet**<br>
Diet is another high-impact area where small changes yield substantial results. I follow a nutrient-dense approach composed of ~30% protein, ~30% carbs and ~40% fats, based on my genetics to support stable energy, muscle maintenance and cognitive clarity. Avoiding processed foods, refined sugars and trans fats is a must to eliminate inflammatory triggers. At the same time, including nutrient-rich foods such as vegetables, legumes, meats and nuts to ensure hitting all nutritional needs. By sticking to a consistent clean diet, in addition to intermittent fasting, you’ll notice profound improvements in various aspects of your life. 

**Exercise**<br>
Rather than focusing on excessive hours at the gym, I advise efficient workouts bringing maximum results with minimal time investment if you’re not interested in competitions or athletic performance. My routine includes a mix of weightlifting/bodyweight exercises, cardio and flexibility work, spread out in shorter, consistent sessions. This balance is ideal to maintain muscle mass, supports cardiovascular health and enhances mobility without overloading my system. Don’t forget constant low intensity physical activity during the day; a sedentary lifestyle is catastrophic for your shape and health.

These basics form a solid health and performance foundation by applying the 80/20 principle, without overcomplicating the routine. It not only saves time and energy but also generates the greatest impact, leaving room for more advanced practices. Explore the *advanced protocol* if you want to go further.

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 30px 0;">

# Advanced protocol
## 1 - Sleep
- **Light exposure**
	- Morning light exposure: Early sunlight exposure (on skin and eyes) is beneficial to regulates the circadian rhythm.
	- Evening light management: No blue light. Only red light in the evening. Wear blue light blocking glasses and use blue light filters on your laptop and phone.
- **Ideal bedroom temperature** : Set your bedroom temperature no higher than 18°C. If comfortable, sleep without a blanket or with lighter bedding to stay cool.
- **Breathe right**: Avoid mouth breathing during sleep! Consider mouth taping or a device to ensure nasal breathing, which supports better oxygenation. It's not normal to have a full night of sleep and waking up tired.
- **Air quality matters**: Use a HEPA air filter and add NASA-recommended plants to enhance air quality and remove some pollutants.
- **Silence and darkness**: No noise, no light. Opt for a totally dark, quiet room. A hard mattress and grounding sheet can improve comfort and recovery.
- **Avoid stimulants before bed**: Cut out stimulants (caffeine, alcohol, …) in the hours leading up to bed to prevent disrupted sleep cycles.
- **Sleep supporting supplements** : Magnesium glycinate (helps with relaxation and muscle recovery), apigenin (promotes calmness), CBD (assists with stress management).

4 hrs of restorative (Deep and REM)

## 2 - Diet

In optimizing my diet, I focus on nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory foods to support energy, cellular health and longevity. I also be careful that I'm not allergic to any of the food included in the diet. Overall, eat any type of **whole food plant based diet** (something like the Mediterranean diet or Blue Zone related diet is convenient for most people). Here’s a look at my food choices and meal structure to help guide your own diet protocol.

![overview](/assets/images/Biohacking/overview.png){: style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:auto;"}

### Daily food routine
**8:00 AM - Fasting**
![fasting](/assets/images/Biohacking/fasting.png){: style="width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:auto; border-radius:20px;"}

**12:00 AM - Lunch**
<br>
My breakfast centers around a nutrient-dense but light meal to provide sustained energy (without reactive hypoglycemia or sugar crash caused by carbs).
- 150g lentils 
- 1-2 avocados
- Vegetables like arugula or cucumber
- Radishes or carrots (or Broccoli / Cauliflower)
- Fermented foods like olives, pickles, kimchi or cabbage
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Fenugreek
<br>

**5:00 PM - Snack**
<br>
Mid-morning or afternoon, nutrient-rich snack of mixed nuts to support healthy fats and minerals. My go-to mix includes:
- Few brazil nuts (rich in selenium, crucial for thyroid function)
- Macadamia nuts
- Pistachios
- Walnuts
- Blanched almonds
<br>

**8:00 AM - Dinner**
<br>
A combination of carbs with meat/fish, as a carb back-loading strategy (restricting carbs intake throughout the day to as low as 30 grams and consuming all carbs at dinner, post training).
- 300g sweet potatoes or 250g millet
- 50g cooked chickpeas or 50g kidney beans
- Grass-fed beef or wild caught salmon
- Feta or parmesan
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Onion or garlic
- Spices (cinnamon, ginger, parsley)
- Apple cider vinegar

*Note that beans and lentils are soaked or sprouted to remove anti-nutrients such as lectins, phytates and glucosinolates.*

To support healthy blood sugar levels and reduce the impact of carb rich meals, it’s interesting to include compounds known to control blood sugar spikes (cinnamon, berberine, C3G, ACV, fenugreek and bitter melon). They greatly help regulate glucose absorption and reduce insulin spikes, ultimately improving metabolic health when taken with carb heavy meals.

### Water intake
I drink **molecular hydrogen (H₂) water**, which is infused with hydrogen gas to deliver specific health benefits beyond basic hydration. Molecular hydrogen acts as a therapeutic antioxidant and offers several unique advantages. It neutralizes harmful free radicals like hydroxyl radicals without disrupting essential redox signaling. Molecular hydrogen also acts as a regulator of the body’s natural antioxidant systems. It upregulates the production of enzymes like glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, which are critical for combating oxidative stress at the cellular level.

### Foods and drinks I avoid
I steer clear of anything that could trigger inflammatory response or has been proved to have negative impact on my health based on my biomarkers, including:
- **Oils & fats**: Avoid hydrogenated oils, canola, corn, soybean oils and PUFA. Trans fats are literally poison, they are incorporated into cell membrane phospholipids and change their function. These oils are highly processed (oxidize easily) and can promote inflammation.
- **Processed & fried foods**: No junk food, fried items or highly processed snacks.
- **Sugars and artificial sweeteners**: Avoid refined sugars, gluten, high-fructose corn syrup, aspartame and sucralose. Exclude refined carbs such as bread, pasta and any high-carb processed grains. Remove also any wheat and oat products. Excluding these foods helps maintain stable blood sugar and improve gut health. 
- **Anti-nutrients**: Foods high in lectins, phytic acid and oxalates (found in some grains and legumes). Depending on your genetics, be careful with nightshades and histamines. They can reduce the body’s absorption of essential minerals and may irritate the gut lining. Be careful when you’re eating in large quantities of these foods. Always soaked these foods to support better nutrient absorption and and remove anti-nutrients.
- **Estrogenic foods** : Foods that can mimic or elevate estrogen in the body, such as soy and flax should not be consumed, especially for male. They can disrupt hormone balance, especially if consumed in high amounts. For those sensitive to hormone fluctuations, eliminating these foods can help improve hormonal balance.
- **Alcohol**: Alcohol particularly disrupts my sleep. It also strains the liver and can cause inflammation in the gut. To not affect cognitive function and overall clarity, I limit my consumption to once a week maximum, in small quantities.
- **Coffee**: While coffee has antioxidants, it can also overstimulate the nervous system and affect cortisol levels in those who are sensitive like me. Reducing coffee helps maintain balanced energy levels and reduces stress on the adrenal system.

*Note: This is a guide, not a rulebook. The above plan is based on my genetic needs and specific to my biomarker feedback. Always personalize your diet to align with your own biomarkers.*

## 3 - Exercise

Exercise is one of the most powerful tools we have to improve health and extend lifespan AND healthspan. Few hours a week can make a big difference. Here’s a breakdown of the elements of my training protocol.

### Weekly training
My complete exercise routine (strength, hypertrophy, cardio and mobility) can be done in 5-15 hours per week. It’s split into 3-5 days of strength training, mainly weightlifting and gymnastics, and 2 days of cardio. In addition, flexibility, balance and mobility exercises are performed 5 days per week.
- **Strength training (3-5 days per week)**: Compound movements (bench press, military press, squats, clean and jerk) and bodyweight exercises (dips, pull-ups, muscle-ups) that engage multiple muscle groups. Strength training isn’t only about muscle, it’s about protecting bone density and improving metabolism.
- **Cardio (2 days per week)**:
	- **Zone 2 Cardio (moderate intensity)**: 120 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio per week, where I can comfortably maintain a conversation. Despite appearances, zone 2 is absolutely necessary to improve aerobic fitness. Activities include generally long light jogging or cycling sessions.
	- **Zone 5 cardio (high intensity)**: 90 minutes of high-intensity cardio are incorporated each week in my training. Zone 5 improves cardiovascular fitness and can stimulate growth hormones. HIIT session or crossfit WOD centered around box jumps, jump rope and rowing is ideal here.
- **Flexibility and mobility (5 days per week)**: These exercises are the foundation to stay highly functional by keeping joints healthy and improving posture : they support functional strength. The incorporation of stretching or yoga is a must-have in the routine to keep muscles flexible and joints resilient.

### Daily movement
- **10k - 20k daily steps**: Intense exercise is no substitute for low-intensity activity throughout the day. Regular movement all day long is key to vitality. Aim for 10k steps as a bare minimum to keep your body active and your energy levels up, or 20k steps to keep a body fat level below 10%.
- **Post-meal movement**: Take a few minutes walk after each meal. This helps manage blood sugar, aids digestion and prevents that post-meal slump in most people.
- **Frequent breaks**: Depending on your job, you can be more or less seated for extended periods, so get up and move every 30-60 minutes. Walk and stretch to reset your posture and improve circulation. If you have a sedentary lifestyle, you can opt for a treadmill desk.

### Single most important exercise for health
**Trampoline workouts**, or **rebounding**, are an effective way to boost health and fitness. Unlike most high-impact exercises like running, jumping on a trampoline is easy on the joints because the trampoline absorbs shock, which protects knees, hips and spine. The added bonus is the up-and-down motion, doing wonders for the lymphatic system, helping flush out toxins and support immunity. Not only does trampoline exercise get the heart pumping for a great cardio workout, it also strengthens muscles and bones (confirmed by t-score from DEXA scan). This makes it a fantastic option to improve bone density, balance and coordination. 10 minutes of rebounding are integrated in my daily routine.

### The trap of overtraining 
Pushing the body too hard without enough rest can actually slow down progress but not only this; it will probably weaken the immune system and lead to injuries. Overtraining causes fatigue to build up over time, making you feel less energized and more prone to aches/strains. Overtime, it can also mess with sleep and stress levels because of the excessive amount of cortisol produced, as the body’s recovery systems get overwhelmed.
Rest days are just as important as workout days; they‘re good for muscle and nervous system. Recovery lets muscles repair and the nervous system reset. By giving your body the downtime it needs, you’ll come back stronger, but it’s highly dependent on your lifestyle and eventual biohacking protocol. In my case, I take 1 rest day per week (sometimes 0) because I don't need more. Always consult some metrics or biomarkers to assess whether a workout will be beneficial or not (you can adapt the intensity and duration). Before training, I always use a *CNS tap test* to check the state of my nervous system and I consult my *HRV* on my Whoop. Listen to your body, and remember that smart training includes knowing when to step back.

### Diet strategy : carb backloading
If you’re doing intense exercise, especially later in the day, try carb backloading: consuming carbs primarily after your workout. This strategy can help replenish glycogen stores, improve recovery and optimize insulin sensitivity while keeping blood sugar levels steady throughout the day. It has completely changed the way I train, for the better!

### Hydratation : replenishing what you lose
Electrolytes are essential for hydration, especially after sweating during long cardio sessions or sauna use. To keep my electrolyte balance, I use *Quinton marine plasma*, a natural seawater solution packed with minerals and trace elements. Electrolytes like sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium are essential for muscle function, nerve signaling and maintaining fluid balance.<br>
I turn to *Quinton hypertonic* when I’ve been sweating heavily. It’s my go-to for quickly replacing lost electrolytes, keeping me hydrated and supporting recovery. Quinton not only replaces lost electrolytes but also provides a host of trace elements. Simple, effective, it’s an essential part of my routine to avoid fatigue.

## 4 - Supplements and nootropics

Some compounds can provide an extra layer of support by targeting specific biological processes. Their high concentration makes them particularly effective but they can also be unsafe, so proceed with caution. Here is my current stack:

### Daily supplementation routine

**8:00 AM - Upon waking**<br>
Fish oil rich in EPA and DHA°<br>
Vitamin D3 + K2°<br>
Magnesium L-Threonate°<br>
Maca°°<br>
Black ginger°°<br>
Spermidine°°<br>
NR or NMN°°<br>
CoQ10°°

**12:00 AM - During meal**<br>
Tongkat Ali°°<br>
Horny goat weed°°<br>
Cistanche°°

**6:00 PM - Pre-workout**<br>
L-citrulline° (or/and Arginine°° or/and AAKG°°)<br>
Beta-alanine°°<br>
Beta-ecdysterone°°

**11:00 PM - Before bed**<br>
Magnesium glycinate°<br>
Apigenin°°<br>
White jelly mushroom°°<br>
CBD°°

° basic stack containing essential nutrients most people need and support general wellness. 
<br>
°° advanced stack which targets specific processes (hormonal support, cellular health, muscle performance and mental clarity).

### Cycling strategy: 5 days on – 2 days off
<br>
To prevent the body from becoming too accustomed to these compounds, which can reduce their effectiveness over time, I follow a 5-day-on (week days) 2-day-off cycle (week-end). I don’t want to develop tolerance and maintain the potency of the supplements by giving the body a break.
